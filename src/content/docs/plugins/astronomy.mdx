The Astronomy Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that allows users to view stars and constellations from the perspective of a selected ground-based sensor.

## Features

- Switch to an astronomy-focused camera mode
- Draw constellations when a star manager is loaded
- Clear orbits and change the legend to astronomy mode
- Integrate with other KeepTrack components for a seamless experience

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. An "Astronomy View" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. The icon is initially disabled until a sensor is selected
</Steps>

## Usage

<Steps>
1. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
2. Click the "Astronomy View" icon in the bottom menu
3. The view will switch to astronomy mode, showing stars and constellations
4. Click the icon again to return to the default view
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Astronomy Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **CatalogManager**: Checks if the star manager is loaded
- **OrbitManager**: Clears in-view orbits when entering astronomy mode
- **DrawManager**: Reinitializes GL context when exiting astronomy mode
- **UiManager**: Hides side menus when exiting astronomy mode
- **MainCamera**: Switches between astronomy and default camera modes
- **StarManager**: Draws or clears constellations
- **LegendManager**: Changes the legend to astronomy or default mode

## Development

When extending or modifying the Astronomy Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers an event handler for the `setSensor` event to enable/disable the bottom icon
- The plugin interacts with various KeepTrack managers and components

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconElementName`: The HTML element ID for the bottom icon
- `bottomIconLabel`: The label text for the bottom icon
- `bottomIconImg`: The image source for the bottom icon
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Determines if the icon is initially disabled (default: true)

## Troubleshooting

- If the astronomy view is not displaying correctly, ensure that a sensor is selected
- Check if the star manager is loaded for constellation display
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components (CatalogManager, OrbitManager, etc.) are properly initialized

  Note that this plugin is still under development and may have limited functionality or unexpected behavior.
