Dilution of Precision (DOP) is a term used in satellite navigation and geomatics to describe the geometric strength of satellite configuration used to determine a receiver's position. The term is also used to describe the impact of satellite geometry on positional measurement precision.

## Types of DOP

There are four main types of DOP:

1. **Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP):** The ratio of the volume of the 3D error ellipsoid to the volume of the horizontal error ellipse.

2. **Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP):** The ratio of the 3D position error to the horizontal position error.

3. **Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP):** The ratio of the horizontal position error to the 2D horizontal position error.

4. **Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP):** The ratio of the vertical position error to the horizontal position error.
