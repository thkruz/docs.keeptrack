The Time Machine Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides a visual representation of the growth of satellite populations over time. This plugin was created in collaboration with EPFL's [Cosmos Archaeology exhibit](https://epfl-pavilions.ch/en/archive/cosmos-archaeology-dark-cloud-of-debris), offering users a unique perspective on the evolution of Earth's orbital environment.

## Features

- Simulates the historical growth of satellite populations from 1957 to the present day
- Visualizes satellites by year of launch
- Customizable playback speed and delay settings
- Option for looping playback
- Integration with KeepTrack's color scheme and group management systems

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

1. A "Time Machine" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. Visual feedback through color changes and orbit displays
3. Toast notifications indicating the current year in the simulation (optional)

<Aside>
  The Time Machine plugin uses KeepTrack's toast notification system to display the current year. This can be disabled in the settings if desired.
</Aside>

## Usage

1. Click the "Time Machine" icon in the bottom menu to start the simulation
2. Watch as satellites are added to the visualization year by year
3. The simulation will automatically stop at the present day
4. Click the icon again to stop the simulation at any time

<Aside type="tip">
  You can customize the playback speed by adjusting the `timeMachineDelay` setting in the KeepTrack configuration.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Time Machine Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **GroupManager**: Creates and selects groups of satellites by launch year
- **ColorSchemeManager**: Applies color schemes to highlight satellite groups
- **OrbitManager**: Manages the display of satellite orbits
- **UiManager**: Handles UI updates and toast notifications

## Configuration Options

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `timeMachineDelay`: Controls the delay between each year in the simulation
- `timeMachineDelayAtPresentDay`: Sets the pause duration when reaching the present day
- `loopTimeMachine`: Enables continuous looping of the simulation
- `isDisableTimeMachineToasts`: Disables year notifications during playback
- `timeMachineLongToast`: Extends the duration of year notifications

<Aside>
  These configuration options can be adjusted in the KeepTrack settings to customize the Time Machine experience.
</Aside>

## Development Notes

When extending or modifying the Time Machine Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses asynchronous timeouts to manage the year-by-year progression
- The `historyOfSatellitesPlay` method initiates the simulation
- Each year is processed in the `playNextSatellite` method

<Aside type="caution">
  Be mindful of performance when modifying the plugin, especially for long-running simulations or when dealing with large satellite populations.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the simulation doesn't start, check if the bottom icon is properly selected
- Ensure that the required KeepTrack components (GroupManager, ColorSchemeManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- For performance issues, consider adjusting the `timeMachineDelay` setting or limiting the number of displayed satellites

<Aside>
  The Time Machine plugin was developed in collaboration with EPFL's Cosmos Archaeology exhibit, showcasing the potential for educational and research applications of KeepTrack's visualization capabilities.
