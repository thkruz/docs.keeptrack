description: A KeepTrack plugin that enables visualization of sensor field of view (FOV).

The Sensor FOV Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for visualizing the field of view (FOV) of selected sensors in the space visualization.

## Features

- Toggle sensor FOV visualization on and off
- Integration with sensor selection and management
- Automatic enabling/disabling based on sensor selection status

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI element:

- A "Sensor FOV" icon in the bottom menu for quick access

<Aside>
  The icon is disabled by default and becomes enabled only when a sensor is selected.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Toggling Sensor FOV Visualization
<Steps>
1. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
2. Click the "Sensor FOV" icon in the bottom menu
3. The visualization will update to show the selected sensor's field of view
4. Click the icon again to disable the FOV visualization
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Sensor FOV Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SensorManager**: Responds to sensor selection events
- **UiManager**: Manages the bottom menu icon state
- **SensorSurvFence**: Coordinates with other sensor visualization plugins

<Aside>
  When enabling the Sensor FOV visualization, the plugin automatically disables the Sensor Surveillance Fence visualization to avoid conflicting views.
</Aside>

## Development

When extending or modifying the Sensor FOV Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for sensor selection and UI interactions
- The `enableFovView` and `disableFovView` methods control the visualization state

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconCallback`: Function called when the bottom icon is clicked
- `bottomIconLabel`: Label for the bottom menu icon
- `bottomIconImg`: Image for the bottom menu icon
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Sets the initial disabled state of the icon

<Aside type="caution">
  Ensure that any modifications to the FOV visualization logic also update the corresponding mesh generation in the `SensorFovMesh` class.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the FOV is not visible after enabling, ensure that a sensor is properly selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components (SensorManager, etc.) are properly initialized

<Aside>
  The Sensor FOV visualization may impact performance when displaying multiple sensors simultaneously. Consider optimizing the mesh generation process if extending the plugin for multi-sensor support.
