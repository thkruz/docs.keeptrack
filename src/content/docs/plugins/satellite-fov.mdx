The Satellite Field of View (FOV) Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for visualizing and managing the field of view of satellites. It allows users to create, customize, and remove FOV cones for selected satellites.

## Features

- Create and visualize FOV cones for selected satellites
- Customize FOV cone settings including field of view angle and color
- Manage multiple active FOV cones
- Reset all FOV cones with a single click
- Keyboard shortcut for quick FOV cone toggle

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Satellite FOV" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with FOV cone settings and a list of active cones
3. A settings submenu for customizing individual FOV cones
4. A reset button to clear all FOV cones
</Steps>

## Usage

### Creating an FOV Cone
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection tool
2. Click the "Satellite FOV" icon in the bottom menu
3. Adjust the default settings if desired
4. The FOV cone will be created for the selected satellite
</Steps>

<Aside>
  You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + C` to quickly toggle the FOV cone for the currently selected satellite.
</Aside>

### Customizing FOV Cone Settings
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite with an active FOV cone
2. Open the Satellite FOV side menu
3. Adjust the settings in the "Sensor Design" and "Color Settings" sections
4. The FOV cone will update in real-time as you change the settings
</Steps>

### Managing Active FOV Cones
<Steps>
1. Open the Satellite FOV side menu
2. View the list of active FOV cones under "Active Sensors"
3. Click on a cone in the list to select its corresponding satellite
4. Click the remove icon next to a cone to delete it
</Steps>

  The currently selected satellite's FOV cone will be highlighted in the list for easy identification.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Satellite FOV Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SceneManager**: Manages the creation and rendering of FOV cone meshes
- **SoundManager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions
- **InputManager**: Handles keyboard shortcuts for FOV cone toggling

## Development

When extending or modifying the Satellite FOV Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- FOV cones are implemented using the ConeMesh class
- The plugin registers event handlers for satellite selection and mesh updates

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding new features, ensure that the ConeMesh class is updated if necessary to support any new visualization requirements.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- Default FOV angle and color settings can be adjusted in the side menu
- Individual FOV cone settings can be customized for each satellite

## Troubleshooting

- If FOV cones are not appearing, ensure that a satellite is selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components (SelectSatManager, SceneManager, etc.) are properly initialized

<Aside>
  Remember that FOV cones are only available for satellite objects. If you can't create an FOV cone, make sure you have selected a valid satellite and not another type of space object.
</Aside>

## Performance Considerations

- The plugin optimizes performance by only updating FOV cones when necessary
- Large numbers of active FOV cones may impact rendering performance

<Aside type="tip">
  If you experience performance issues with multiple FOV cones, try reducing the number of active cones.
