The Watchlist Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that allows users to create and manage a list of priority satellites for tracking. This plugin enhances the user experience by providing quick access to satellites of interest and integrating with other KeepTrack features.

## Features

- Create and manage a list of priority satellites
- Add satellites individually or in bulk
- Remove satellites from the watchlist
- Save and load watchlists
- Integrate with other KeepTrack components for enhanced functionality

## User Interface

The Watchlist Plugin adds the following UI elements:

- A "Watchlist" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
- A side menu with options to add, remove, save, and load watchlist entries
- A help overlay providing information about the plugin's functionality

<Aside type="tip">
  The watchlist is saved in your browser's local storage, allowing it to persist between sessions.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Adding Satellites to the Watchlist

1. Click the "Watchlist" icon in the bottom menu
2. Enter satellite numbers in the "New Satellite(s)" input field
3. Click the add button or press Enter to add the satellites

<Aside>
  You can add multiple satellites at once by separating their numbers with commas.
</Aside>

### Removing Satellites from the Watchlist

1. Open the Watchlist menu
2. Click the remove icon next to the satellite you want to remove

### Saving and Loading Watchlists

- To save your current watchlist, click the "Save List" button
- To load a previously saved watchlist, click the "Load List" button and select your file

<Aside type="caution">
  Loading a watchlist will overwrite your current watchlist. Make sure to save your current list if you want to keep it.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Watchlist Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **Orbit Manager**: Manages the display of orbits for watchlist satellites
- **Line Manager**: Draws lines between sensors and visible watchlist satellites
- **UI Manager**: Handles toasts and search functionality
- **Color Scheme Manager**: Updates the color scheme based on watchlist changes

## Development Considerations

When extending or modifying the Watchlist Plugin, keep in mind:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- Watchlist data is stored in the `watchlistList` array
- The `updateWatchlist` method is central to refreshing the plugin's state and UI

<Aside type="note">
  The plugin includes basic input validation, but consider adding more robust checks when extending its functionality.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If satellites aren't appearing in the watchlist, ensure they exist in the catalog
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components are properly initialized

By leveraging the Watchlist Plugin, users can efficiently manage and monitor their satellites of interest within the KeepTrack application.
