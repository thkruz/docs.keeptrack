The Screenshot Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for capturing high-resolution screenshots of the current view. It enhances the user experience by allowing easy sharing and documentation of specific space visualization scenarios.

## Features

- Capture screenshots in multiple resolutions (HD, 4K, 8K)
- Add customizable watermarks and copyright information
- Include classification information when applicable
- Accessible via bottom menu icon and right-click context menu

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Take Photo" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A "Save Image" option in the right-click context menu
3. A submenu in the right-click context menu with resolution options (HD, 4K, 8K)
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The bottom menu icon captures a 4K resolution screenshot by default.
</Aside>

## Screenshot Information

Screenshots include:
- The current view of the KeepTrack application
- A watermark with copyright information (if enabled)
- Classification text (if applicable)

## Usage

### Capturing a Screenshot via Bottom Menu
<Steps>
1. Click the "Take Photo" icon in the bottom menu
2. The screenshot will be automatically saved in 4K resolution
</Steps>

### Capturing a Screenshot via Right-Click Menu
<Steps>
1. Right-click anywhere on the visualization

<Aside type="tip">

</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Screenshot Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SettingsManager**: Configures resolution and copyright settings
- **Renderer**: Accesses the canvas for capturing the current view
- **ClassificationManager**: Retrieves classification information if applicable

## Development

When extending or modifying the Screenshot Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- Screenshot capture is queued and executed at the end of the draw loop for optimal timing
- Watermark and classification text are added using a temporary canvas

<Aside type="caution">
  Be mindful of performance implications when capturing very high-resolution screenshots, especially on less powerful devices.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `copyrightOveride`: Allows customization of the copyright text
- `classificationStr`: Sets the classification text to be displayed on the screenshot

## Troubleshooting

- If screenshots are not saving, check browser permissions for file downloads
- Ensure that the application has finished loading before attempting to take a screenshot
- For classification text issues, verify that the `classificationStr` setting is correctly configured

<Aside>
  The plugin uses the HTML5 Canvas API to generate screenshots. Ensure that the user's browser supports this feature for proper functionality.

Remember to respect copyright and classification guidelines when sharing screenshots captured with this plugin.
