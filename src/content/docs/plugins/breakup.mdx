The Breakup plugin is a complex component of the KeepTrack application that simulates satellite breakups. It allows users to create multiple debris objects from a selected satellite, modifying orbital parameters to simulate various breakup scenarios.

<Aside type="danger">
  The Breakup plugin is designed for educational and research purposes. It provides a simplified model of satellite breakups and should not be used for critical decision-making in real-world space operations.
</Aside>

## Features

- Simulate satellite breakups by creating multiple debris objects
- Customize breakup parameters including inclination, period, and right ascension variations
- Specify the number of debris pieces to generate
- Automatically position debris based on the parent satellite's current location
- Integration with other KeepTrack components for seamless operation

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Create Breakup" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with detailed breakup configuration options
3. Form inputs for customizing breakup parameters
4. A submit button to initiate the breakup simulation
</Steps>

## Breakup Configuration Options

Users can configure the following parameters for a simulated breakup:

- Inclination Variation (0 to 1 degree)
- Period Variation (0 to 5 percent)
- Right Ascension Variation (0 to 1 degree)
- Number of Debris Pieces (10 to 1000)

<Aside type="tip">
  When simulating a breakup, start with small variations (e.g., 0.2 degrees for inclination and right ascension, 2% for period) and a moderate number of debris pieces (e.g., 25-50). This will help you understand the plugin's behavior before creating larger, more complex simulations.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Simulating a Satellite Breakup

<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection tool
2. Click the "Create Breakup" icon in the bottom menu
3. Adjust the breakup parameters in the side menu form:
   - Inclination Variation
   - Period Variation
   - Right Ascension Variation
   - Number of Debris Pieces
4. Click the "Create Breakup" button to initiate the simulation
</Steps>

### Limitations

- The plugin currently only supports breakups for satellites in near-circular orbits (apogee - perigee â‰¤ 1000 km)
- The maximum number of debris pieces is limited to 1000

<Aside type="caution">
  Creating a large number of debris pieces (e.g., 500-1000) can significantly impact application performance on low to mid-range devices. If you experience performance issues, reduce the number of debris pieces or use a more powerful device.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Breakup plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **CatalogManager**: Manages the satellite catalog and creates new debris objects
- **OrbitManager**: Updates orbit buffer data for new debris objects
- **TimeManager**: Provides current simulation time for calculations
- **MainCamera**: Adjusts camera behavior during breakup simulation
- **UiManager**: Manages UI updates and search functionality
- **SatMath**: Performs various orbital calculations

## Development

When extending or modifying the Breakup plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses the OrbitFinder class to calculate new orbital parameters
- The plugin creates multiple debris objects by modifying TLE data
- Debris objects are created as analyst satellites with IDs starting from `CatalogManager.ANALYST_START_ID`

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `maxDifApogeeVsPerigee_`: Maximum difference between apogee and perigee for eligible satellites (default: 1000 km)
- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Requires a satellite to be selected for the plugin to function (default: true)
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: The bottom icon is initially disabled (default: true)

## Breakup Simulation Process

<Steps>
1. Retrieve the selected satellite's data
2. Calculate the satellite's current position (latitude, longitude, altitude)
3. Determine the satellite's direction of motion (ascending or descending)
4. Create a new orbit based on the satellite's current position
5. Generate debris objects by modifying the new orbit's parameters:
   - Vary inclination within the specified range
   - Adjust eccentricity slightly
   - Modify mean motion (period) within the specified range
   - Distribute debris across multiple right ascension offsets
6. Create new satellite objects for each piece of debris
7. Update the satellite catalog and orbit buffer with the new debris objects
8. Trigger a search to display the newly created debris
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- If the "Create Breakup" icon is disabled, ensure a valid satellite is selected and its orbit is near-circular
- Check the browser console for error messages if the breakup simulation fails
- If debris objects are not visible after simulation, try adjusting the search settings or time controls

## Security Considerations

- The plugin includes basic input validation for form fields
- When extending the plugin, ensure proper sanitization for all user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

- Creating a large number of debris objects (e.g., 1000) may impact application performance
- The plugin optimizes calculations by using the OrbitFinder class and distributing debris across multiple right ascension offsets

By understanding and utilizing the Breakup plugin, users can simulate complex satellite breakup scenarios within the KeepTrack application, providing valuable insights into orbital debris propagation and space situational awareness.
