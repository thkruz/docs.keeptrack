- Customize visual elements like orbits, Earth representation, and celestial objects
- Adjust color schemes for various object types
- Set performance-related options
- Enable or disable specific functionalities

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Settings" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with various configuration options
3. Color pickers for customizing object colors
4. Toggle switches for enabling/disabling features
5. Input fields for numeric settings
</Steps>

## Settings Categories

### General Settings

- Satellite visibility options (LEO, MEO, GEO, Starlink, etc.)
- Object type visibility (Payloads, Rocket Bodies, Debris)
- Orbit and celestial object rendering options
- Earth and atmosphere visualization settings
- User interface preferences

<Aside>
  Some settings, like showing agencies on the globe, are planned for future implementation and may be disabled in the current version.

### Color Settings

Users can customize colors for:
- Payloads

## Usage

To access and modify settings:

<Steps>
1. Click the "Settings" icon in the bottom menu to open the settings panel

3. Adjust settings using toggles, color pickers, and input fields
4. Click "Update Settings" to apply changes
5. Use "Reset to Defaults" to restore original settings
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Settings Menu Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **Sound Manager**: Plays audio feedback for user interactions
- **Color Scheme Manager**: Updates visualization colors based on user preferences
- **Orbit Manager**: Adjusts orbit rendering based on settings
- **Scene**: Updates Earth, atmosphere, and celestial object rendering
- **Persistence Manager**: Saves user preferences for future sessions

<Aside type="caution">
  Some settings may require a reload of certain components or the entire application to take full effect. The plugin attempts to apply changes in real-time where possible.
</Aside>

## Development Notes

When extending or modifying the Settings Menu Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses a combination of HTML templates and dynamic JavaScript for the UI
- Color pickers are implemented using a third-party library (jquery-colorpicker)
- Settings are persisted using the PersistenceManager

<Aside>
  Future development should consider moving plugin-specific settings into their respective plugins for better modularity.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If settings don't seem to apply, ensure you've clicked the "Update Settings" button
- For performance issues related to certain settings, try disabling complex visualizations or reducing the number of visible objects
- If colors reset unexpectedly, check for conflicts with other plugins or color scheme changes

Remember to check the browser console for any error messages if you encounter unexpected behavior while using the Settings Menu.
