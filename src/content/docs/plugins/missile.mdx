  The trajectory math is based on work from MIT to model the Soviet Union's R-7 that launched Sputnik. This is designed for educational purposes only.
</Aside>

The Missile Plugin is a sophisticated component of the KeepTrack application that enables users to simulate and visualize complex missile launch scenarios. This plugin offers a range of features for both educational purposes and strategic analysis, allowing users to explore various aspects of ballistic missile trajectories and global strike capabilities.

## Features

- Create custom missile attacks with user-defined parameters
- Utilize pre-defined scenarios for quick simulations
- Simulate launches from multiple countries and specific locations
- Visualize detailed missile trajectories on the main view
- Conduct mass raid simulations for large-scale scenarios
- Integration with KeepTrack's UI and core functionality
- Real-time orbit updates for accurate missile path representation
- Support for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs)
- Multiple warhead simulation capabilities

## User Interface

The Missile Plugin significantly enhances the KeepTrack user interface with the following elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Missile" icon in the bottom menu for quick access to missile-related functions
2. A comprehensive side menu with options to create and customize missile attacks
3. A detailed form for inputting launch and target locations
4. Dropdown menus for selecting pre-defined launch sites and targets from various countries
5. Custom input fields for precise latitude and longitude coordinates
6. A "Launch Missile Attack" button to initiate the simulation
7. A "Show All Missiles" button to filter and display active missile objects
8. An error display area for user feedback on invalid inputs or simulation issues
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  The side menu is resizable using a click-and-drag functionality, allowing users to adjust the view based on their preferences or screen size.
</Aside>

## Missile Information and Simulation Details

The Missile Plugin provides extensive information and simulation capabilities:

- Launch location (latitude and longitude)
- Target location (latitude and longitude)
- Missile type and country of origin
- Detailed trajectory information including:
  - Altitude profile
  - Ground track (latitude and longitude at each time step)
  - Time of flight
- Simulated physical characteristics:
  - Number of warheads
  - Missile dimensions (length and diameter)
  - Fuel properties and burn rates
- Country-specific missile capabilities and limitations

<Aside type="note">
  The plugin uses sophisticated mathematical models to simulate missile trajectories, taking into account factors such as Earth's curvature, atmospheric effects, and gravitational forces.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Creating a Custom Missile Attack

<Steps>
1. Click the "Missile" icon in the bottom menu to open the side menu
2. From the "Type of Attack" dropdown, select "Custom Missile"
3. Choose a launch location from the "Launch Location" dropdown or select a submarine option for SLBM scenarios
4. If a submarine launch is selected, enter custom latitude and longitude for the launch position
5. Select a target from the "Target Location" dropdown or choose "Custom Impact" for a user-defined target
6. If "Custom Impact" is selected, enter the target latitude and longitude
7. Review all inputs for accuracy
8. Click "Launch Missile Attack" to initiate the simulation
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  For submarine-launched missiles, you can enter custom launch coordinates to simulate different positions in the ocean, adding realism to SLBM scenarios.
</Aside>

### Running a Pre-defined Attack Scenario

<Steps>
1. Click the "Missile" icon in the bottom menu
2. From the "Type of Attack" dropdown, select a pre-defined scenario:
   - Russia to USA
   - Russia to USA w/ Subs
   - China to USA
   - North Korea to USA
   - USA to Russia
   - USA to China
   - USA to North Korea
3. Click "Launch Missile Attack" to start the simulation
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Pre-defined scenarios may simulate large numbers of missiles simultaneously, which can be computationally intensive. Ensure your system can handle the load before running these simulations.
</Aside>

### Viewing Active Missiles

<Steps>
1. Open the Missile side menu
2. Click the "Show All Missiles" button at the bottom of the menu
</Steps>

This action will filter the main view to show only active missile objects, making it easier to focus on the ongoing simulations.


## Integration with KeepTrack

The Missile Plugin deeply integrates with several core KeepTrack components:

- **TimeManager**: Retrieves the current simulation time for synchronizing missile launches
- **UiManager**: Handles all UI updates related to missile functions
- **CatalogManager**: Integrates missile objects into the main object catalog
- **OrbitManager**: Updates missile orbits in real-time for accurate trajectory representation
- **SettingsManager**: Checks for mobile mode settings to adjust the UI accordingly

<Aside type="note">
  The tight integration with these components allows the Missile Plugin to provide a seamless and realistic simulation experience within the broader KeepTrack environment.
</Aside>

## Development and Extensibility

When extending or modifying the Missile Plugin, developers should consider the following:

- The plugin adheres to the KeepTrackPlugin architecture for consistency and modularity
- It registers multiple event handlers for various KeepTrack events, including:
  - `uiManagerInit`: For setting up the UI elements
  - `uiManagerFinal`: For finalizing UI setup and adding event listeners
  - `bottomMenuClick`: For handling the missile icon click in the bottom menu
  - `hideSideMenus`: For properly hiding the missile menu when required
  - `updateLoop`: For continuous updates of missile orbits
  - `onHelpMenuClick`: For displaying missile-specific help information
- The core missile calculations and data management are handled by the separate `missileManager` module
- Developers can extend the plugin by:
  - Adding new missile types or countries
  - Implementing more sophisticated trajectory calculations
  - Creating additional pre-defined scenarios
  - Enhancing the UI for more detailed missile information display

## Performance Considerations

The Missile Plugin can be computationally intensive, especially when simulating multiple missiles or mass raid scenarios:

- Each missile's trajectory is recalculated every frame for accuracy
- Large numbers of simultaneous missiles can impact overall application performance
- Users should be cautious when creating many missiles on less powerful devices

<Aside type="caution">
  When developing new features or modifying existing ones, always consider the performance implications, especially for mobile or low-power devices.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration and Customization

The plugin offers several areas for configuration and customization:

- `isMobileModeEnabled`: A flag to adjust UI behavior for mobile devices
- Missile characteristics (e.g., dimensions, fuel properties) can be adjusted in the code for different simulation requirements
- Pre-defined launch sites and targets are stored in separate data structures (e.g., `UsaICBM`, `RussianICBM`) which can be extended or modified
- The `calculateAngle_` function can be adjusted to modify the missile's flight characteristics

<Aside type="tip">
  When adding new missile types or scenarios, remember to update both the UI dropdowns in the HTML and the corresponding logic in the `missileSubmit` function to ensure consistency.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

To ensure optimal use of the Missile Plugin, consider the following:

- Regularly check the browser console for error messages related to missile simulations
- Ensure all required KeepTrack components (TimeManager, UiManager, etc.) are properly initialized before using missile features
- For performance issues:
  - Reduce the number of simultaneous missile launches
  - Simplify trajectories by adjusting calculation parameters
  - Consider using pre-calculated trajectories for complex scenarios
- Regularly test the plugin with various scenarios to ensure accuracy and performance across different use cases
