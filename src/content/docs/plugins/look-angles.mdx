The Look Angles Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for calculating and displaying look angles between a selected sensor and satellite.

## Features

- Calculate look angles (azimuth, elevation, and range) between a sensor and satellite
- Display look angles in a table format
- Option to show only rise and set times
- Configurable calculation length and interval
- Export look angle data to CSV

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Look Angles" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with a table displaying look angle data
3. Settings to configure calculation parameters
4. A download button to export data as CSV
</Steps>

## Look Angle Information Displayed

- Time in [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)
- Elevation (El) in degrees measured from the horizon
- Azimuth (Az) in degrees measured clockwise from true north
- Range (Rng) in kilometers

## Usage

### Viewing Look Angles
<Steps>
1. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
2. Select a satellite
3. Click the "Look Angles" icon in the bottom menu
4. View the detailed look angle information in the side menu table
</Steps>

### Configuring Look Angle Calculations
<Steps>
1. Open the Look Angles side menu
2. Click the settings icon (gear)
3. Adjust the following settings:
   - Toggle "Show Only Rise and Set Times"
   - Set "Calculation Length (Days)"
   - Set "Interval (Seconds)"
4. The look angles will automatically update based on your settings
</Steps>

<Aside>
   When you propagate a satellite's position further into the future it becomes less accurate.<br/>
   There is rarely any reason to use a calculation length greater than 7 days.
</Aside>

### Exporting Look Angle Data
<Steps>
1. Open the Look Angles side menu
2. Click the download icon
3. The data will be saved as a CSV file
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Look Angles Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SensorManager**: Gets the current sensor information
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations and offsets
- **SoundManager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions

## Development

When extending or modifying the Look Angles Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SelectSatManager plugin
- Look angle calculations are performed using the SensorMath utility

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRiseSetOnly`: Determines if only rise and set times should be shown (default: true)
- `angleCalculationInterval`: The interval between each line of look angles in seconds (default: 30)
- `lengthOfLookAngles`: The length of time to calculate look angles for in days (default: 2)

## Troubleshooting

- If look angles are not displaying, ensure that both a sensor and a satellite are selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required dependencies (SelectSatManager, SensorManager, etc.) are properly initialized
