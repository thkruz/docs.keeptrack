The Analysis Menu Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides various analysis and export functions for satellite data.

## Features
- Export catalog data in various formats (TLE, 3LE, CSV)
- Find close objects and potential reentries
- Calculate and export best pass times for satellites
- Analyze orbital trends (currently commented out)

<Aside>
  3LE stands for "Three Line Element Set," a format used to describe the orbits of satellites and space objects. It is just a TLE with the name of the satellite on the first line.

## User Interface
<Steps>
1. Bottom menu icon labeled "Analysis Menu"
2. Side menu with various export and analysis options
3. Forms for inputting satellite numbers for best pass time calculations
4. Buttons for initiating different analysis and export functions
</Steps>

## Analysis Information Displayed
- Catalog data in various formats (TLE, 3LE, CSV)
- List of close objects or potential reentries
- Best pass times for selected satellites, including:
  - Start and stop times
  - Azimuth, elevation, and range
  - Pass score
  - Time in coverage
  - Minimum range and maximum elevation

## Usage

### Exporting Catalog Data
<Steps>
1. Click the "Analysis Menu" icon in the bottom menu
2. Choose the desired export format (e.g., "Export Official TLEs", "Export Catalog CSV")
3. The data will be saved in the selected format
</Steps>

### Finding Close Objects or Reentries
<Steps>
1. Click the "Analysis Menu" icon
2. Select "Find Close Objects" or "Find Reentries"
3. The application will search for and display the results
</Steps>

### Calculating Best Pass Times
<Steps>
1. Click the "Analysis Menu" icon
2. Enter satellite numbers in the "Satellite Numbers" field
3. Click "Generate Best Pass Times"
4. The results will be exported as a CSV file
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  This menu is often used to quickly add export features to KeepTrack. Many then grow to become their own plugins later with more settings and features.
  If you are try to get information of KeepTrack that isn't offered in another plugin, request it on the [Github page](https://github.com/thkruz/keeptrack.space/) and it is usually easy to add it here.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Analysis Menu plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:
- **CatalogManager**: Accesses satellite and object data
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations
- **SensorManager**: Retrieves sensor information
- **UiManager**: Manages user interface interactions and notifications
- **SatMath**: Performs satellite position and look angle calculations
- **Scene**: Retrieves sun position data

## Development

When extending or modifying the Analysis Menu Plugin, consider the following:
- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for UI interactions and sensor selection
- The findCloseObjects and findBestPass methods contain the core analysis logic
- Export functionality is handled by the CatalogExporter class

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:
- `bottomIconElementName`: Sets the ID for the bottom menu icon
- `bottomIconImg`: Specifies the icon image for the bottom menu
- `sideMenuElementName`: Sets the ID for the side menu container
- `helpTitle` and `helpBody`: Configures the help text for the plugin

## Troubleshooting
- If exports are not working, check browser console for error messages
- Ensure a sensor is selected before attempting to calculate best pass times
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components (CatalogManager, SensorManager, etc.) are properly initialized
