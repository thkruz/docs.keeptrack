- Support for over 40 countries

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Countries" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with a list of available countries

## Usage

### Filtering Satellites by Country
<Steps>
1. Click the "Countries" icon in the bottom menu
2. Scroll through the list in the side menu
3. Click on a country name to filter satellites
4. The visualization and search results will update to show only satellites from the selected country
</Steps>

<Aside>
  When you select a country, KeepTrack creates a group for that country if it doesn't already exist, allowing for quick access in future sessions.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Countries Menu Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **GroupsManager**: Creates and manages country-based satellite groups
- **CatalogManager**: Retrieves satellite data for the selected country
- **UiManager**: Handles UI updates and search functionality
- **SearchManager**: Updates search results based on the selected country
- **SelectSatManager**: Deselects any currently selected satellite when a country is chosen

## Development

When extending or modifying the Countries Menu Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses the StringExtractor utility to get country codes
- Country selection is handled by the `countryMenuClick_` static method
- Group creation and selection logic is in the `groupSelected_` static method

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconImg`: Image for the bottom menu icon (flag.png)
- `bottomIconLabel`: Label for the bottom menu icon ("Countries")
- `sideMenuElementName`: ID for the side menu element ("countries-menu")

<Aside>
  When adding new countries to the list, ensure to update the HTML in the `sideMenuElementHtml` property and provide appropriate country codes in the StringExtractor utility.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If a country doesn't appear in the list, check the `sideMenuElementHtml` property in the plugin code
- Ensure that the required KeepTrack components (GroupsManager, CatalogManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- For performance issues with countries having a large number of satellites, consider optimizing the group creation and search result population methods
