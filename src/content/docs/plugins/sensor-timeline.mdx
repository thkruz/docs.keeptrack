The Sensor Timeline Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides a visual representation of when a selected satellite is visible from various ground-based sensors over a specified time period.

## Features

- Visualize satellite visibility from multiple sensors on a timeline
- Customize the calculation length, interval, and pass quality thresholds
- Enable/disable specific sensors for the timeline
- Interactive timeline with hover tooltips and click-to-set functionality
- Export timeline as a PNG image

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Sensor Timeline" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with the timeline visualization and settings
3. A canvas element for rendering the timeline
4. Settings to adjust calculation parameters and sensor selection
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The side menu can be resized to fit different screen sizes, automatically adjusting for widescreen or portrait orientations.
</Aside>

## Timeline Visualization

The timeline displays the following information:

- Time axis with hour markers
- Sensor names listed vertically
- Color-coded pass quality (red for bad, yellow for average, green for good)
- Hover tooltips with pass start and end times

<Aside type="tip">
  You can click on a pass in the timeline to set the current time and sensor to that specific pass, allowing for quick navigation to points of interest.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Viewing the Sensor Timeline
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection tool
2. Click the "Sensor Timeline" icon in the bottom menu
3. View the timeline visualization in the side menu
4. Hover over passes to see detailed timing information
5. Click on a pass to set the current time and sensor
</Steps>

### Configuring Timeline Settings
<Steps>
1. Open the Sensor Timeline side menu
2. Click the settings icon (gear)
3. Adjust the following settings:
   - Calculation Length (Hours)
   - Calculation Interval (Seconds)
   - Bad Pass Length (Seconds)
   - Average Pass Length (Seconds)
4. Enable or disable specific sensors using the buttons in the sensor list
</Steps>

<Aside>
  Changes to the settings will automatically update the timeline visualization. This may take a moment for satellites with many visible passes.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Sensor Timeline Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SensorManager**: Manages sensor data and selection
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations and offsets
- **SoundManager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions

## Development

When extending or modifying the Sensor Timeline Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering the timeline
- Pass calculations are optimized to skip periods when a satellite is out of view

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding new features or modifying existing ones, be mindful of performance, especially when dealing with long time periods or many sensors. Consider implementing loading indicators for long-running calculations.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the timeline is not displaying, ensure that a satellite is selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required dependencies (SelectSatManager, SensorManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- If passes are not showing for a specific sensor, check if the satellite's orbit is within the sensor's range

<Aside>
  Remember that the accuracy of the timeline depends on the accuracy of the satellite's orbital elements. For the most up-to-date results, ensure you're using recent TLE data.
