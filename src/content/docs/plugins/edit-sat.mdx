The Edit Sat Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for editing satellite data, including Two-Line Element sets (TLEs).

## Features

- Edit satellite orbital parameters
- Update satellite epoch to current time
- Save and load TLE data
- Visualize changes in satellite orbit
- Integration with other KeepTrack components like SelectSatManager and OrbitManager

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. An "Edit Satellite" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with input fields for editing satellite parameters
3. Buttons for updating, saving, and loading TLE data
4. A right-click context menu option for editing satellites
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  The side menu can be dragged to reposition it on the screen, making it easier to view and edit satellite data while observing the visualization.
</Aside>

## Editable Satellite Information

- Satellite Number (SCC#)
- Epoch Year and Day
- Inclination
- Right Ascension of Ascending Node
- Eccentricity
- Argument of Perigee
- Mean Anomaly
- Mean Motion
- Period

<Aside>
  When editing the Mean Motion, the Period is automatically calculated and vice versa, helping users understand the relationship between these parameters.

## Usage

### Editing Satellite Data
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite in the main view
2. Click the "Edit Satellite" icon in the bottom menu
3. Modify the desired parameters in the side menu
4. Click "Update Satellite" to apply the changes
</Steps>

### Updating Satellite Epoch
<Steps>
1. Open the Edit Satellite menu
2. Click "Update Epoch to Now"
3. The satellite's TLE will be updated with the current time while maintaining its position
</Steps>

### Saving and Loading TLEs
<Steps>
1. After editing a satellite, click "Save TLE" to download the TLE data
2. To load a saved TLE, click "Load TLE" and select the file
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Edit Sat Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Manages the currently selected satellite
- **OrbitManager**: Updates orbit buffer data when changes are made
- **CatalogManager**: Handles satellite data and cruncher messages
- **TimeManager**: Provides current simulation time for epoch updates
- **UiManager**: Displays notifications and manages UI interactions

<Aside type="caution">
  Editing satellite parameters can significantly change its orbit. Always verify the changes in the visualization to ensure the edited orbit is as intended.
</Aside>

## Development

When extending or modifying the Edit Sat Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for UI interactions and satellite selection
- TLE generation and validation are handled by the FormatTle and Sgp4 classes
- The plugin uses the OrbitFinder class for updating satellite epochs

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Determines if a satellite must be selected for the plugin to function
- `isIconDisabled`: Controls whether the bottom icon is initially disabled
- `dragOptions`: Configuration for making the side menu draggable

## Troubleshooting

- If satellite updates fail, check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure that the entered parameters are within valid ranges for TLEs
- For epoch update issues, verify that the current time in the simulation is set correctly

<Aside type="note">
  The Edit Sat Plugin is a powerful tool for manipulating satellite data. Users should have a good understanding of orbital mechanics and TLE formats to use it effectively.
