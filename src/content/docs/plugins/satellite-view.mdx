The Satellite View Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that allows users to change the camera perspective to a satellite-centric view, providing a unique perspective of the space environment from the viewpoint of a selected satellite.

## Features

- Switch between normal camera mode and satellite view mode
- Visual feedback on the bottom menu icon when satellite view is active
- Integration with satellite selection functionality
- Prevents activation when no satellite is selected

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI element:

<Steps>
1. A "Satellite View" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The bottom menu icon changes its appearance when the satellite view is active, providing a visual cue to the user about the current camera mode.
</Aside>

## Usage

<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection functionality
2. Click the "Satellite View" icon in the bottom menu
3. The camera will switch to the perspective of the selected satellite
4. Click the icon again to return to the normal camera mode
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  If you attempt to activate the satellite view without a satellite selected, you'll receive a warning toast message.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Satellite View Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Checks if a satellite is currently selected
- **UiManager**: Displays toast notifications and handles UI updates
- **MainCamera**: Controls the camera type and perspective

## Development

When extending or modifying the Satellite View Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SelectSatManager plugin
- The camera type is toggled between `FIXED_TO_SAT` and `SATELLITE`

<Aside type="tip">
  When implementing new features, consider how they might interact with different camera modes to ensure a consistent user experience.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Set to `true`, requires a satellite to be selected for the plugin to function
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Set to `true`, the bottom icon is initially disabled

## Troubleshooting

- If the satellite view doesn't activate, ensure that a satellite is selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required dependency (SelectSatManager) is properly initialized

<Aside>
  The plugin includes a "shake" effect on the bottom menu icon when trying to activate without a selected satellite, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

Remember that the Satellite View offers a unique perspective that can be particularly useful for understanding a satellite's orientation and immediate environment. However, it may take some getting used to for new users, so consider providing additional guidance or tutorials for this feature.
