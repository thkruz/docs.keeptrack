The Planetarium Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that allows users to view satellites from the perspective of an observer on Earth, similar to a planetarium experience.

## Features

- Switches the camera to a planetarium-like view
- Integrates with the sensor selection functionality
- Adjusts the UI and legend for planetarium mode
- Clears constellation displays when active

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Planetarium View" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. The icon is initially disabled and becomes enabled when a sensor is selected
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The planetarium view is only available when a sensor is selected. Make sure to choose a sensor before attempting to activate the planetarium view.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Activating Planetarium View
<Steps>
1. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
2. Click the "Planetarium View" icon in the bottom menu
3. The view will change to a planetarium-like perspective from the selected sensor's location
</Steps>

### Deactivating Planetarium View
<Steps>
1. Click the "Planetarium View" icon again
2. The view will return to the default Earth-centered perspective
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Deactivating the planetarium view will reset the camera position and clear any in-view orbits. Make sure you've completed any necessary observations before switching back.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Planetarium Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **CameraManager**: Switches between default and planetarium camera modes
- **SensorManager**: Responds to sensor selection events
- **LegendManager**: Updates the legend display for planetarium mode
- **StarManager**: Clears constellation displays when entering planetarium mode
- **OrbitManager**: Clears in-view orbits when exiting planetarium mode

## Development

When extending or modifying the Planetarium Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers an event handler for sensor selection to enable/disable the planetarium icon
- The planetarium view is activated by changing the camera type to `CameraType.PLANETARIUM`
- Some UI elements related to sensors are hidden when entering planetarium mode

<Aside>
  Future development could include implementing a field of view (FOV) display and additional planetarium-specific features.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconElementName`: The HTML element ID for the bottom menu icon
- `bottomIconLabel`: The label text for the bottom menu icon
- `bottomIconImg`: The image source for the bottom menu icon
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Determines if the icon is initially disabled (default: true)

## Troubleshooting

- If the planetarium icon remains disabled, ensure that a sensor has been selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages related to camera or sensor initialization
- If the view doesn't change when activating planetarium mode, verify that the CameraManager is properly initialized

<Aside type="tip">
  Remember that the planetarium view is designed to work in conjunction with the Sensor List Plugin. Always ensure a sensor is selected for the best experience.
