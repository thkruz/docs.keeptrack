The Sensor List Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for managing and interacting with various sensors used in space surveillance and tracking.

## Features
- View and select sensors from different networks and organizations
- Visualize sensor coverage for selected satellites
- Reset sensor selection
- Load the last selected sensor on application startup


## Sensor Categories

The plugin organizes sensors into several categories:

<Steps>
1. Space Surveillance Network (SSN)
2. US Missile Warning
3. US Missile Defense Agency
4. ESA Space Operations Center
5. Leo Labs
6. Russian
7. Chinese
8. Other
</Steps>

:::note
All sensors were created using publicly available data to represent real-world sensor networks.

## User Interface

- Bottom Icon: The plugin adds a "Sensors" icon to the bottom menu for quick access.
- Side Menu: A detailed list of sensors is available in a side menu, organized by category.
- Sensor Selection: Users can select individual sensors or entire groups of sensors.
- Sensor Reset: A "Reset Sensor" button is available to clear the current sensor selection.

## Functionality

- Sensor Selection: Clicking on a sensor in the list sets it as the active sensor for calculations and visualizations.
- Multi-Sensor Visualization: Users can visualize all sensors that have a specific satellite in their field of view.
- Camera Focus: When a sensor is selected, the main camera focuses on its geographical location.
- Persistence: The plugin can save and reload the last selected sensor between sessions.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Sensor List Plugin integrates with several other components of the KeepTrack application:

- **Sound Manager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions.
- **Sensor Manager**: Manages the current sensor selection and sensor data.
- **Main Camera**: Controls the view to focus on selected sensors.
- **Select Sat Manager**: Interacts with satellite selection functionality.
- **Line Manager**: Creates visual lines between sensors and satellites.

## Usage

To use the Sensor List Plugin:

<Steps>
1. Click the "Sensors" icon in the bottom menu to open the sensor list.
2. Browse through the categories and select a sensor or sensor group.
3. The main view will update to focus on the selected sensor's location.
</Steps>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isLoadLastSensor`: If true, the plugin will attempt to load the last selected sensor on startup.
- `isMobileModeEnabled`: Affects certain functionality on mobile devices.

## Development

When extending or modifying the Sensor List Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrack Plugin architecture.
- It registers various event handlers for user interactions and application events.
- Sensor data is stored in the `sensors` object, which can be extended to add new sensors.
- The UI is generated dynamically based on the available sensor data.

## Troubleshooting

- If a sensor fails to load, check the browser console for error messages.
- Ensure that the required dependencies (e.g., DateTimeManager) are properly loaded.
- Verify that the sensor data is correctly formatted and available in the `sensors` object.
