The Next Launches Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for viewing and exporting information about upcoming space launches.

## Features

- Displays a table of upcoming launches with details such as launch window, mission name, location, agency, and country
- Fetches launch data from The Space Devs API
- Allows exporting of launch information to CSV format
- Integrates with KeepTrack's UI and sound systems

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Next Launches" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with a table displaying upcoming launch information
3. An "Export Launch Info" button to save launch data as CSV
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The side menu can be dragged to adjust its size, with a minimum width of 450px and a maximum width of 650px.
</Aside>

## Launch Information Displayed

- Launch Window (start time in UTC)
- Mission Name
- Rocket Name
- Launch Location
- Agency
- Country

<Aside type="tip">
  Clicking on mission names, rocket names, locations, or agencies that have associated URLs will open more detailed information in a colorbox overlay.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Viewing Upcoming Launches
<Steps>
1. Click the "Next Launches" icon in the bottom menu
2. The side menu will open, displaying a table of upcoming launches
3. If data hasn't been fetched yet, the plugin will retrieve it from The Space Devs API
</Steps>

### Exporting Launch Information
<Steps>
1. Open the Next Launches side menu
2. Click the "Export Launch Info" button at the bottom of the menu
3. The launch data will be saved as a CSV file
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Next Launches Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **UI Manager**: Handles UI updates and event registration
- **Sound Manager**: Plays a sound effect when exporting data
- **Error Manager**: Displays warnings if the API is unavailable

<Aside type="caution">
  The plugin uses different API endpoints based on whether it's running on localhost or a production server. This ensures appropriate usage of The Space Devs API resources.
</Aside>

## Development

When extending or modifying the Next Launches Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It fetches data from The Space Devs API and processes it into a standardized format
- The table is dynamically generated based on the fetched launch data

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconImg`: Image for the bottom menu icon (default: calendar2.png)
- `bottomIconLabel`: Label for the bottom menu icon (default: "Next Launches")
- `dragOptions`: Configuration for making the side menu draggable

<Aside>
  The plugin uses a CSS file (next-launches.css) for styling, which is dynamically imported when the plugin is initialized.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the launch table doesn't populate, check the browser console for API-related error messages
- Ensure that the required KeepTrack components (UI Manager, Sound Manager, etc.) are properly initialized
- For issues with the colorbox overlays, verify that the colorbox library is correctly loaded and configured

<Aside type="note">
  The plugin caches the launch data after the first fetch. If you need to refresh the data, you may need to reload the entire application.
