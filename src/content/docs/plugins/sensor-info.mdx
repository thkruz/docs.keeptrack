The SensorInfoPlugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides detailed information about selected sensors used in space surveillance and tracking.

## Features

- Displays detailed information about the selected sensor
- Allows drawing lines from the sensor to the Sun or Moon
- Integrates with other KeepTrack components like SoundManager and LineManager

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Sensor Info" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with detailed sensor information
3. Buttons to draw or remove lines to the Sun and Moon
</Steps>

## Sensor Information Displayed

- Sensor Name
- Country
- Sensor Type
- Latitude and Longitude
- Azimuth range (minimum and maximum)
- Elevation range (minimum and maximum)
- Range (minimum and maximum)
- Frequency Band (for RF sensors)
- Beam Width (for RF sensors)

## Usage

  ### Viewing Sensor Info
    <Steps>
    1. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
    2. Click the "Sensor Info" icon in the bottom menu
    3. View the detailed sensor information in the side menu
    </Steps>
  ### Drawing Lines
    <Steps>
    1. Open the Sensor Info side menu
    2. Click "Draw Line to Sun" or "Draw Line to Moon"
    3. To remove the line, click the button again
    </Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The SensorInfoPlugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SoundManager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions
- **LineManager**: Manages the lines drawn to the Sun and Moon
- **SensorManager**: Retrieves information about the current sensor
- **UiManager**: Displays toast notifications
- **TimeManager**: Gets the current simulation time
- **Scene**: Retrieves positions of the Sun and Moon

## Development

When extending or modifying the SensorInfoPlugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for UI interactions and line additions
- Sensor data is retrieved from the SensorManager

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRequireSensorSelected`: Set to `true` by default, requires a sensor to be selected for the plugin to function
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Set to `true` by default, the bottom icon is initially disabled
- `dragOptions`: Configures the draggability of the side menu

## Troubleshooting

- If the sensor information doesn't update, ensure that a sensor is selected using the Sensor List Plugin
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required KeepTrack components (SensorManager, LineManager, etc.) are properly initialized
