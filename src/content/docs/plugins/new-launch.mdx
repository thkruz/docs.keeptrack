The New Launch Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for generating notional orbital launches by modifying existing satellites with similar parameters.

## Features

- Modify existing satellites to create new launch scenarios
- Select launch locations from a predefined list
- Choose launch direction (North or South)
- Automatically align the selected satellite with the launch site
- Reset simulation time to 00:00:00 to represent relative time after launch
- Integration with other KeepTrack components like SoundManager and ColorSchemeManager

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

1. A "New Launch" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with detailed launch configuration options
3. Input fields for satellite number and inclination
4. Dropdown menus for launch direction and facility selection
5. A submit button to create the launch nominal

<Aside>
The side menu can be dragged to reposition it on the screen for better visibility or access.

## Usage

1. Select a satellite using the main KeepTrack interface
2. Click the "New Launch" icon in the bottom menu
3. The satellite's SCC number and inclination will be automatically filled
4. Choose the launch direction (North or South)
5. Select a launch facility from the dropdown menu
6. Click "Create Launch Nominal" to generate the new launch scenario

<Aside type="caution">
The plugin will disable the submit button and display a warning if the selected satellite's inclination is lower than the launch site's latitude, as this would be an impossible launch scenario.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The New Launch Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **CatalogManager**: Manages satellite data and launch site information
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations and offsets
- **ColorSchemeManager**: Updates the color scheme after launch creation
- **SoundManager**: Plays a lift-off sound when a new launch is created
- **OrbitManager**: Updates orbit buffer data for the new launch

## Development

When extending or modifying the New Launch Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SelectSatManager plugin
- Launch site data is stored in the `launchSites` object
- The `OrbitFinder` class is used to calculate the new orbit parameters

<Aside type="tip">
When adding new launch sites, make sure to update both the `launchSites` object and the HTML dropdown menu in the `sideMenuElementHtml` property.

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconImg`: Image for the bottom menu icon (default: rocket.png)
- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Set to `true`, requires a satellite to be selected for the plugin to function
- `isIconDisabledOnLoad`: Set to `true`, the bottom icon is initially disabled
- `dragOptions`: Configures the draggability of the side menu

## Troubleshooting

- If the launch creation fails, check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure that the required dependencies (SelectSatManager, CatalogManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- Verify that the selected satellite's inclination is appropriate for the chosen launch site
- If the cruncher fails to meet requirements, try selecting a different satellite or launch site

<Aside>
Remember that the created launch nominal is a simulation and may not perfectly represent real-world launch conditions. It's primarily useful for relative time calculations and sensor coverage analysis.
