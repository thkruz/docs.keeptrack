The Multi-Site Look Angles Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for calculating and displaying look angles between a selected satellite and multiple sensors simultaneously.

## Features

- Calculate look angles (azimuth, elevation, and range) between a satellite and multiple sensors
- Display look angles in a table format
- Configurable calculation length and interval
- Enable/disable specific sensors for calculations
- Export look angle data to CSV

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Multi-Site Looks" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with a table displaying multi-site look angle data
3. Settings to enable/disable specific sensors
4. A download button to export data as CSV
</Steps>

## Look Angle Information Displayed

- Time in [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)
- Elevation (El) in degrees measured from the horizon
- Azimuth (Az) in degrees measured clockwise from true north
- Range (Rng) in kilometers
- Sensor Name

## Usage

### Viewing Multi-Site Look Angles
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite
2. Click the "Multi-Site Looks" icon in the bottom menu
3. View the detailed look angle information for multiple sensors in the side menu table
</Steps>

### Configuring Sensor Selection
<Steps>
1. Open the Multi-Site Look Angles side menu
2. Click the settings icon
3. Use the buttons to enable or disable specific sensors:
   - Red buttons indicate disabled sensors
   - Blue buttons indicate enabled sensors
4. The look angles table will automatically update based on your sensor selection
</Steps>

### Exporting Look Angle Data
<Steps>
  1. Open the Multi-Site Look Angles side menu
  2. Click the download icon
  3. The data will be saved as a CSV file named `multisite-[satellite-number]-look-angles.csv`
</Steps>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Multi-Site Look Angles Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SensorManager**: Manages sensor data and selection
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations and offsets
- **SoundManager**: Plays sound effects for user interactions
- **CatalogManager**: Accesses the static set of objects

## Development

When extending or modifying the Multi-Site Look Angles Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SelectSatManager plugin
- Look angle calculations are performed using the SatMath utility
- The plugin filters out sensors that are out of range for the selected satellite

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `lengthOfLookAngles_`: The length of time to calculate look angles for in days (default: 1)
- `angleCalculationInterval_`: The interval between each line of look angles in seconds (default: 30)
- `disabledSensors_`: An array of sensors that are initially disabled

## Troubleshooting

- If look angles are not displaying, ensure that a satellite is selected
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the required dependencies (SelectSatManager, SensorManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- If a sensor is not appearing in the list, check if it has a valid `objName` property

## Performance Considerations

- The plugin optimizes calculations by skipping sensors that are out of range for the selected satellite
- It uses a 3/4 orbital period jump to reduce calculation time for satellites with longer periods
