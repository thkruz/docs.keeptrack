import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Collisions Plugin provides functionality to display and interact with potential satellite collision events in the KeepTrack application.

## Features

- Fetches and displays a list of potential satellite collisions
- Allows users to select and view details of specific collision events
- Updates the application time to the time of the selected collision
- Integrates with other KeepTrack components for satellite selection and time management

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Collisions" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu displaying a table of potential collision events
3. A help popup providing information about the Collisions Menu
</Steps>

## Collision Information Displayed

- Time of Closest Approach (TOCA)
- Satellite numbers for both objects involved
- Maximum probability of collision
- Minimum range between objects (in kilometers)
- Relative speed between objects (in km/s)

## Usage

### Viewing Collision Data
<Steps>
1. Click the "Collisions" icon in the bottom menu
2. The side menu will open, displaying a table of potential collisions
3. If it's the first time opening, the plugin will fetch the collision data
</Steps>

### Interacting with Collision Events
<Steps>
1. Click on a row in the collision table
2. The application will:
   - Select the two satellites involved in the collision
   - Change the simulation time to 30 seconds before the collision event
   - Update the main view to focus on the selected satellites
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use the time controls to adjust the view slightly before or after the collision event for better analysis.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Collisions Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: For selecting the satellites involved in a collision
- **TimeManager**: To update the simulation time to the collision event
- **MainCamera**: To adjust the view focus
- **UiManager**: For handling UI interactions and searches
- **CatalogManager**: To retrieve satellite information

<Aside>
  The plugin uses the SOCRATES (Satellite Orbital Conjunction Reports Assessing Threatening Encounters in Space) data for collision predictions. This data is fetched from a JSON file located at './tle/SOCRATES.json'.
</Aside>

## Development

When extending or modifying the Collisions Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- Collision data is fetched asynchronously and stored in the `collisionList_` property
- The UI is generated dynamically based on the fetched collision data

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `collisionDataSrc`: The source URL for the collision data JSON file
- `dragOptions`: Configures the draggability of the side menu

<Aside type="caution">
  If you modify the `collisionDataSrc`, ensure that the new data source follows the same format as the SOCRATES JSON file to maintain compatibility.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the collision table is empty, check the browser console for any error messages
- Verify that the `collisionDataSrc` URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure that the required KeepTrack components (SelectSatManager, TimeManager, etc.) are properly initialized

<Aside type="note">
  The collision data is only fetched once per session. If you need to refresh the data, you may need to reload the application.
