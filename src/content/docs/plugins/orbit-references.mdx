The Orbit References Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that allows users to generate analyst satellites in orbit based on a selected satellite's parameters. This plugin is useful for creating reference points and analyzing orbital characteristics.

## Features

- Generate analyst satellites along the orbit of a selected satellite
- Create up to 360 reference satellites (limited by orbital period)
- Automatically add generated satellites to the search string for easy visualization
- Integrate with the satellite info box for quick access

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI element:

<Steps>
1. A "Generate Orbit Reference Satellites..." link in the satellite info box top links section
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The "Generate Orbit Reference Satellites..." link only appears when a satellite is selected and the satellite info box is open.
</Aside>

## Usage

<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the Select Sat Manager
2. Open the satellite info box
3. Click on the "Generate Orbit Reference Satellites..." link in the top links section
4. The plugin will generate analyst satellites and update the search to include them
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Generated analyst satellites will have IDs starting from `80000`, which is defined by `CatalogManager.ANALYST_START_ID`.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Orbit References Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **CatalogManager**: Adds analyst satellites and manages satellite data
- **UiManager**: Handles UI updates and search functionality

## Development

When extending or modifying the Orbit References Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SatInfoBox and SelectSatManager plugins
- Analyst satellites are created using the satellite's TLE parameters
- The plugin uses the [OOTK library](https://github.com/thkruz/ootk) for TLE manipulation and formatting

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding new analyst satellites, be mindful of performance implications. Generating a large number of satellites may impact application responsiveness.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration:

- `dependencies`: Array of plugin dependencies (SatInfoBox and SelectSatManager)
- `isReferenceSatsActive`: Boolean flag to track if reference satellites have been generated

<Aside>
  The `isReferenceSatsActive` flag can be used to prevent duplicate generation of reference satellites or to implement cleanup functionality in future updates.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the "Generate Orbit Reference Satellites..." link doesn't appear, ensure a satellite is selected and the info box is open
- Check the browser console for any error messages related to TLE generation or satellite addition
- Verify that the required dependencies (SelectSatManager, CatalogManager) are properly initialized

<Aside type="note">
  The number of generated reference satellites may vary depending on the orbital period of the selected satellite. Satellites with shorter periods will have fewer reference points to maintain a consistent spacing.
