## Integration with KeepTrack

The Launch Calendar Plugin integrates with the following KeepTrack components:

- **SettingsManager**: Used to prevent accidental closure of the colorbox
- **ColorboxManager**: Handles opening and closing of the colorbox overlay

## Development

When extending or modifying the Launch Calendar Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It uses the `openColorbox` function to display the calendar
- The plugin prevents colorbox closure for 2 seconds after opening to avoid accidental closures

<Aside type="caution">
  When modifying the plugin, ensure that the URL for Gunter's Space Page is kept up-to-date to maintain functionality.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `bottomIconElementName`: The ID of the bottom menu icon element
- `bottomIconImg`: The image used for the bottom menu icon
- `bottomIconLabel`: The label for the bottom menu icon
- `isForceHideSideMenus`: Set to `true` to hide side menus when the calendar is open

## Troubleshooting

- If the calendar doesn't open, check your internet connection
- Ensure that the browser allows pop-ups for the KeepTrack site
- If the calendar closes immediately after opening, check that the `settingsManager.isPreventColorboxClose` flag is being set correctly

<Aside>
  The Launch Calendar Plugin relies on an external website. If the calendar fails to load, it may be due to changes or issues with Gunter's Space Page.
