The Watchlist Overlay Plugin is an extension of the KeepTrack application that enhances the Watchlist functionality by providing a visual overlay of next pass times for satellites in the user's watchlist. This plugin offers quick insights into satellite visibility and integrates closely with the main Watchlist Plugin.

## Features

- Display next pass times for watchlist satellites
- Color-coded overlay for easy interpretation of pass timing
- Automatic updates based on simulation time
- Integration with sensor selection and satellite tracking

## User Interface

The Watchlist Overlay Plugin adds the following UI elements:

- An "Overlay" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
- A side menu displaying the overlay information
- Color-coded pass time information for each satellite in the watchlist

<Aside type="tip">
  The overlay is color-coded for quick visual interpretation:
  - Yellow: Satellite currently in view
  - Blue: Pass occurring within 30 minutes after or 10 minutes before the current time
  - White: Future passes not meeting the above criteria
</Aside>

## Usage

1. Ensure you have satellites added to your watchlist
2. Select a sensor using the Sensor List Plugin
3. Click the "Overlay" icon in the bottom menu to display the pass time information

<Aside type="caution">
  The overlay requires both a populated watchlist and a selected sensor to function. If either is missing, you'll receive a notification.
</Aside>

## Functionality

- Automatically calculates next pass times for watchlist satellites
- Updates the overlay every 10 seconds or when significant changes occur
- Allows users to click on satellite entries to center the map view on that satellite

<Aside>
  Pass calculations are performed for a 12-hour window (0.5 days) from the current simulation time.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Watchlist Overlay Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **Watchlist Plugin**: Retrieves the list of satellites to display
- **Sensor Manager**: Uses the selected sensor for pass calculations
- **Time Manager**: Bases calculations on the current simulation time
- **Orbit Manager**: Manages the display of in-view orbits
- **Line Manager**: Draws lines between sensors and visible watchlist satellites

## Development Considerations

When extending or modifying the Watchlist Overlay Plugin, keep in mind:

- The plugin depends on the Watchlist Plugin and follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- Pass calculations are performed using the `SensorMath.nextpassList` method
- The `updateNextPassOverlay_` method is crucial for refreshing the overlay display

<Aside type="note">
  Consider optimizing pass calculations for large watchlists to maintain performance.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If the overlay is not updating, check if a sensor is selected and the watchlist is populated
- Ensure that the simulation time is within the expected range for pass calculations
- Verify that the Watchlist Plugin is properly initialized and functioning

The Watchlist Overlay Plugin enhances the KeepTrack experience by providing users with quick, visual access to upcoming satellite passes, making it easier to plan observations and track objects of interest.
