The Reports Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for generating quick reports in text format for various satellite and sensor data.

## Features

- Generate reports for Azimuth Elevation Range (AER)
- Generate reports for Latitude Longitude Altitude (LLA)
- Generate reports for Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates
- Generate reports for Classical Orbital Elements (COEs)
- Export reports as text files

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Reports" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu with buttons for generating different types of reports
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  The Reports icon is disabled by default and only becomes active when a satellite is selected.
</Aside>

## Report Types Available

<Steps>
1. Azimuth Elevation Range (AER)
2. Latitude Longitude Altitude (LLA)
3. Earth Centered Inertial (ECI)
4. Classical Orbital Elements (COEs)
</Steps>

## Usage

### Generating a Report
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection tool
2. Click the "Reports" icon in the bottom menu to open the Reports side menu
3. Choose the desired report type by clicking the corresponding button
4. A new window will open with the generated report
5. Click the "Download Report" link at the top of the report window to save the report as a text file
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Reports are generated for a 72-hour period starting from the current simulation time, with data points every 30 seconds.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Reports Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SensorManager**: Gets the current sensor information (if applicable)
- **TimeManager**: Retrieves the current simulation time

## Development

When extending or modifying the Reports Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It depends on the SelectSatManager plugin
- Report generation methods are private and prefixed with an underscore (e.g., `generateAzElRng_()`)
- The plugin uses the OOTK library for orbital calculations

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding new report types, ensure to update both the side menu HTML and add corresponding generation methods.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Determines if a satellite must be selected for the plugin to function (default: true)
- `bottomIconLabel`: Label for the bottom menu icon (default: "Reports")
- `bottomIconImg`: Image for the bottom menu icon
- `dragOptions`: Configuration for side menu draggability (default: not draggable)

## Troubleshooting

- If the Reports icon is disabled, ensure that a satellite is selected
- If a report fails to generate, check the browser console for any error messages
- Ensure that pop-ups are allowed for the KeepTrack site to open report windows

<Aside type="caution">
  Some reports (like AER) require both a satellite and a sensor to be selected. If you encounter issues, make sure both are properly selected.
