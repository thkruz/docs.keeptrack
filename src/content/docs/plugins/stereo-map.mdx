The Stereo Map Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that offers a 2D stereographic map visualization for satellite ground traces and sensor coverage. It enhances the user's understanding of satellite orbits and visibility from ground stations.

## Features

- Display satellite ground traces on a 2D map
- Visualize sensor coverage and satellite visibility
- Interactive time selection along the ground trace
- Keyboard shortcut for quick access
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A "Stereo Map" icon in the bottom menu for quick access
2. A side menu containing the stereographic map
3. Interactive elements on the map (satellite icon, sensor icon, ground trace points)
</Steps>

<Aside>
  The map can be resized automatically based on the window size, optimizing for both widescreen and portrait orientations.
</Aside>

## Usage

### Viewing the Stereographic Map
<Steps>
1. Select a satellite using the satellite selection tool
2. Click the "Stereo Map" icon in the bottom menu or press the 'M' key
3. The map will display showing the satellite's ground trace and current position
4. If a sensor is selected, its position and coverage will also be shown
</Steps>

### Interacting with the Map
- Click on yellow or red squares along the ground trace to change the simulation time to that point
- The satellite icon shows the current position of the satellite
- Yellow portions of the ground trace indicate when the satellite is visible to the selected sensor
- Red portions indicate when the satellite is not visible

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use the 'M' keyboard shortcut to quickly toggle the Stereo Map view.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Stereo Map Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SelectSatManager**: Retrieves the currently selected satellite
- **SensorManager**: Gets information about the current sensor
- **TimeManager**: Handles time-related calculations and updates
- **CatalogManager**: Accesses satellite data for calculations
- **SoundManager**: Provides audio feedback for user interactions

<Aside>
  The plugin automatically updates the map when satellite data is crunched, ensuring an up-to-date visualization.
</Aside>

## Development

When extending or modifying the Stereo Map Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- Map drawing is performed on an HTML canvas element
- The ground trace is calculated using satellite orbital parameters
- The map includes copyright and classification information

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding new features, be mindful of performance, especially when calculating and drawing the ground trace for long periods.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isRequireSatelliteSelected`: Requires a satellite to be selected for the plugin to function (default: true)
- `isIconDisabled`: Controls whether the bottom icon is initially disabled
- `mapWidth` and `mapHeight`: Set in the `settingsManager` to control the map dimensions

## Troubleshooting

- If the map is not updating, check if a satellite is selected
- Ensure that the browser window is active, as some browsers may limit background updates
- For performance issues, consider adjusting the number of points used to draw the ground trace

<Aside>
  The map uses a stereographic projection, which may cause some distortion, especially near the poles. This is normal and does not affect the accuracy of the satellite positions.
</Aside>

Remember that the Stereo Map provides a 2D representation of a 3D orbit, which can be a useful complement to the main 3D visualization in KeepTrack.
