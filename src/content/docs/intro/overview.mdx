## Getting Started

One of the best things about KeepTrack.Space is how easy it is to get started. Here is all you have to do to get going for the first time:
<Steps>
1. <LinkCard
    title="Load the KeepTrack App"
    description="Visit keeptrack.space/app/ to load the 3D app."
    href="https://keeptrack.space/app/"
   />
3. ~Setup the time and date.~
    <br />
    Date and time are set automatically.
4. ~Load the satellites you need individually.~
    <br />
    Satellites are loaded automatically.
5. ~Create real sensors by hand~
    <br />
    Sensors are created automatically.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
    KeepTrack takes a unique approach of giving you everything by default and letting you remove/modify from there. You still have complete control, but can often get what you need in only a few clicks using the defaults.
