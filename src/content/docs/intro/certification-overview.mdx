description: An overview of the certification process for the KeepTrack application.
---

KeepTrack has been developed and maintained through significant investment of time and resources over the past eight years.
To ensure its continued availability and improvement, we're introducing an optional certification program.
This program aims to offset infrastructure costs, compensate contributors, and support ongoing maintenance while keeping KeepTrack free for all users.
Please consider supporting the project by participating in the certification program.

Regardless of your decision to pursue certification, the training materials and documentation will continue to be available to help you learn and use
the application effectively without any cost. The certification program is entirely optional and is not required to use KeepTrack. You can read more about the
[decision to introduce the certification program here](/docs/intro/certification-faq).
