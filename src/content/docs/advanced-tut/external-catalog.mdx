KeepTrack.Space allows you to load external satellite catalogs using Two-Line Element (TLE) files. This feature enables you to customize your view and focus on specific sets of satellites. Let's explore how to use this powerful functionality.

## Loading an External TLE File

You can load an external TLE file by adding a `tle` parameter to the KeepTrack.Space URL.

<Steps>
1. Start with the base KeepTrack.Space URL: `https://keeptrack.space/`
2. Add a question mark `?` followed by `tle=` and the URL of your TLE file
3. If the TLE URL contains special characters, wrap it in quotes `""`
</Steps>

### Example: Loading Brightest Satellites

To load a catalog of the brightest satellites:

```
https://keeptrack.space/app/?tle=https://api.keeptrack.space/v1/static/brightest/txt
```

### Example: Loading with Special Characters

For URLs with special characters, use quotes:

```
https://keeptrack.space/app/?tle="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=fengyun-1c-debris&FORMAT=2le"
```

<Aside>
  Always ensure you're using a trusted and up-to-date source for your TLE files to get accurate satellite positions.

## Exclusive External Catalog View

By default, KeepTrack.Space will merge your external catalog with its internal database. However, you can choose to view only the satellites from your external catalog.

<Steps>
1. Add the `external-only` parameter to your URL
2. Separate parameters with an ampersand `&`
3. Add your `tle` parameter as usual
</Steps>

### Example: Viewing Only Fengyun-1C Debris

To view only the Fengyun-1C debris catalog:

```
https://keeptrack.space/app/?external-only&tle="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=fengyun-1c-debris&FORMAT=2le"
```

## Understanding Catalog Merging

When you load an external catalog without the `external-only` parameter, KeepTrack.Space intelligently merges the data:

- For satellites already in the internal database, the TLE data is updated with your external data.
- All other internal data (e.g., country of origin, purpose) is preserved for context.
- Satellites not in the internal database are added as new "Special" satellites.

This merging provides a rich, contextualized view of your custom satellite set.

  Experiment with different TLE sources to focus on specific groups of satellites, such as weather satellites, communication constellations, or space debris.

## Practice Exercise

Try loading these different catalogs and observe how the visualization changes:

1. Load the "Active Satellites" catalog:
   ```
   https://keeptrack.space/app/?tle="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=2le"
   ```

2. View only the Starlink constellation:
   ```
   https://keeptrack.space/app/?external-only&tle="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=starlink&FORMAT=2le"
   ```

3. Load the "100 (or so) Brightest" catalog and compare it with the default view:
   ```
   https://keeptrack.space/app/?tle="https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=visual&FORMAT=2le"
   ```

By mastering the use of external catalogs, you can customize KeepTrack.Space to focus on the specific satellites or debris that interest you most, enhancing your space situational awareness and exploration capabilities.
