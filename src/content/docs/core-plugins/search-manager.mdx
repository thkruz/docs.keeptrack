The search bar in KeepTrack is a powerful tool that allows users to quickly find and select specific space objects.

## Opening the Search Bar

The search bar can be toggled open or closed:

- Click the search icon in the top menu
- Use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + F` to focus on the search bar

## Search Functionality

### Basic Search

1. Type at least 3 characters to initiate a search
2. Results update in real-time as you type
3. The search is case-insensitive

### Search Criteria

You can search for space objects using various identifiers:

- Object Name
- NORAD Catalog Number (SATCAT)
- International Designator
- Bus Type
- Launch Vehicle

<Aside type="tip">
  For numerical searches (e.g., NORAD IDs), you can separate multiple entries with commas. Do not use spaces.
</Aside>

## Search Results

### Display

- Results appear in a dropdown below the search bar
- Each result shows the object's name and identifying number (e.g., NORAD ID)
- Matching parts of the search are highlighted

### Interaction

- Click on a result to select that object
- Hover over a result to highlight it in the main view
- The number of results is limited (default: 350) for performance

  You can change the maximum number of search results in the settings plugin.
</Aside>

### Visual Feedback

- Selected search results are highlighted in the main view
- The color scheme may change to emphasize the selected group

## Advanced Features

### Group Creation

- Search results automatically create a temporary group
- This group can be used for further analysis or visualization

### Integration with Other Features

- In Satellite Field of View (FOV) mode, only payloads are searchable
- Search results can trigger updates in other components (e.g., Satellite FOV calculations)

## Performance Considerations

- Searches are optimized for large datasets
- Numeric-only searches (e.g., NORAD IDs) use a faster search algorithm
- Certain object types (e.g., sensors, markers) are excluded from search for efficiency

## Closing the Search

You can close the search bar in one of two ways:

- Right click and select `Clear Screen`
- Click the search icon again

<Aside type="note">
  Closing the search will clear the results and reset the view to its default state.

## Additional Notes

- The search bar is a built-in singleton but will be made into an actual core plugin eventually for better maintainability
- Searches are added to the Url so they can be shared or bookmarked
