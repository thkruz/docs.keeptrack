The Date Time Manager Plugin is a component of the KeepTrack application that provides functionality for managing and interacting with the simulation time.

## Features

- Displays current simulation date and time
- Allows users to edit the simulation time
- Updates Julian Day (JDay) display
- Integrates with other KeepTrack components for time-based calculations

## User Interface

The plugin adds the following UI elements:

<Steps>
1. A Julian Day (JDay) display
2. A clickable date/time display
3. A date/time input form with a date picker
</Steps>

## Date Time Information Displayed

- Julian Day (JDay): The number of days since the start of the year
- Current simulation date and time

<Aside>
  The Julian Day displayed here is not the same as the astronomical Julian Date. It represents the day of the year (1-365 or 366).
</Aside>

## Usage

### Viewing Current Date and Time
- The current simulation date and time are displayed in the top menu

### Changing Simulation Time
<Steps>
1. Click on the displayed date/time in the top menu
2. Use the date picker that appears to select a new date and time
3. The simulation will update to reflect the new time
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  When changing the simulation time, the application will automatically update various calculations and visualizations to reflect the new time.
</Aside>

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Date Time Manager Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **TimeManager**: Handles time calculations and synchronization
- **ColorSchemeManager**: Updates color schemes based on time changes
- **UiManager**: Updates UI elements related to time changes
- **UrlManager**: Updates the URL to reflect time changes

## Development

When extending or modifying the Date Time Manager Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for UI interactions and time updates
- The plugin uses jQuery UI's datepicker for the date/time input

<Aside type="caution">
  When modifying time-related functionality, be careful to maintain synchronization with other time-dependent components of the application.
</Aside>

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `divContainerId`: The ID of the main container div (default: 'datetime')
- `dateTimeInputTbId`: The ID of the date/time input textbox (default: 'datetime-input-tb')

## Troubleshooting

- If the date/time display is not updating, check if the TimeManager is properly initialized
- For issues with the date picker, ensure that jQuery UI is correctly loaded
- If time-based calculations seem incorrect after a time change, verify that all relevant components are being notified of the time update

<Aside>
  Remember that changing the simulation time affects many aspects of the application, including satellite positions, sensor calculations, and various overlays. Always test thoroughly after making changes to time-related functionality.
