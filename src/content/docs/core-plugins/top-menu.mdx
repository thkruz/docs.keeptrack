## Integration with KeepTrack

The Top Menu Plugin integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **SoundManager**: Controls audio playback and muting
- **UiManager**: Handles UI initialization and updates
- **AdviceManager**: Provides context-sensitive help and tutorials

## Development

When extending or modifying the Top Menu Plugin, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It registers event handlers for UI initialization and finalization
- HTML content is added dynamically using the `keepTrackApi.html` template literal tag

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- Icon images are imported and can be easily replaced or updated
- CSS classes control the appearance and behavior of menu items

## Troubleshooting

- If the sound toggle doesn't work, check if the SoundManager is properly initialized
- For search issues, verify that the search input field is properly connected to the search functionality

<Aside>
  The plugin uses error handling to warn users if the SoundManager is not enabled, helping to identify configuration issues.

Remember to test all features of the Top Menu Plugin after making any modifications, as it's a central component of the user interface and affects the overall user experience of the KeepTrack application.
