The Select Sat Manager plugin is a core component of the KeepTrack application that handles the selection and interaction with various space objects, including satellites, sensors, and other celestial bodies.

## Features

- Select and deselect space objects
- Switch between primary and secondary selected objects
- Update visualization based on selection (e.g., color, size)
- Integrate with other KeepTrack components (e.g., camera, sound, UI)
- Handle different types of space objects (satellites, sensors, missiles, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts for object selection and switching

## User Interface

The plugin primarily works in the background, affecting the main visualization and other UI components. It doesn't add specific UI elements but influences:

- Object highlighting in the main view
- Camera behavior
- Information display in other plugins (e.g., Sat Info Box)

## Usage

### Selecting an Object
<Steps>
1. Click on an object in the main visualization
2. Use the search function to find and select an object
3. The selected object will be highlighted and centered in the view
</Steps>

### Switching Between Primary and Secondary Objects
<Steps>
1. Select a primary object
2. Select a secondary object
3. Use the '[' or ']' keys to switch between primary and secondary selections
</Steps>

<Aside>
  Switching between primary and secondary objects allows for quick comparison and analysis of two different space objects.

## Integration with KeepTrack

The Select Sat Manager integrates with several KeepTrack components:

- **CatalogManager**: Retrieves object data
- **CameraManager**: Controls camera focus and behavior
- **SoundManager**: Plays sounds on selection
- **ColorSchemeManager**: Updates object colors based on selection
- **OrbitManager**: Manages orbit visualization for selected objects
- **UiManager**: Updates UI elements based on selection

<Aside type="caution">
  The integration with multiple KeepTrack components makes the Select Sat Manager a central part of the application's functionality.

## Development

When extending or modifying the Select Sat Manager, consider the following:

- The plugin follows the KeepTrackPlugin architecture
- It handles different types of space objects (SpaceObjectType enum)
- Selection logic is separated for different object types (e.g., satellites, sensors)
- The plugin manages both primary and secondary object selections

## Code Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

- `isDisableSelectSat`: Disables satellite selection functionality if set to true

<Aside type="caution">
  Be cautious when modifying the selection logic, as it affects many other parts of the application. Always test thoroughly after making changes.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- If object selection isn't working, check if `isDisableSelectSat` is set to true
- Ensure that the required KeepTrack components (CatalogManager, CameraManager, etc.) are properly initialized
- Check the browser console for any error messages related to object selection or data retrieval

<Aside>
  If you encounter issues with specific object types not being selectable, verify that the object's SpaceObjectType is correctly handled in the selectSat method.
